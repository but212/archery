## Project Management 

### DevSpace Roadmap
This is a collection of roadmap priority items for this project. Please add a PR to update this doc and ideally reference issues where applicable.

### Short-Term Priorities
- Set up Projects, wiki, blog.
- Add outlines and essentials to the setup
- Get the characters, scenes, actions and special effects
- Improve support for git in container (better sync for .git/ folder, non-blocking sync) [https://github.com/loft-sh/devspace/issues/2174]
- Get external help and advice

### Long-Term Priorities
- Improve 
- Redesign 
- Better upgrade 
- Docker 
- Improve use 

Get started by **creating a name for this project**.

Or **try polling a name recommened** among us **[poll](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### Scenes Control

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## UI/UX Animations

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Game Tutorial

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
