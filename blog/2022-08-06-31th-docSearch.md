## docSearch issues

I have trouble getting started with Algolia, especially with the pushing the site's index data to Algolia server, which has the following schematics;

local site --> server (where the app is deployed) <-- crawler  --> algolia db as indexed objects

And they have detailed instructions and snippets or cli to go with. They support all major documentation platforms for jump-starters. So their doc gets complicated and require where you are at with your current development and what to choose from their set of tables.

I find it useful to refer to their show-case sites which resemble your development interface and requirements, such as Astromers in my case.
